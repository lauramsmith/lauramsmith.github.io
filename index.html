	    		<div class="row"> </div>
	    		<h4>I'm a second-year from Southern California suburbia, and I study Computer Science at UC Berkeley.</h4>
	    		<h4>Some of my passions include watching the Disneyland fireworks with a pretzel in hand,</h4>
	    		<h4>sharing a good meal with my friends and family,</h4>
	    		<h4>and, most importantly, always learning.</h4>
	    	</div>

	    	<h4 style="padding-top:40px;">Scroll down to learn more about me, the things I've done, and what I'm passionate about!</h4>

	    		<h4>At Troy High School, I was first introduced to Computer Science. I took a logic course and some basic programming classes. I also took Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra & Differential Equations at Cal State Fullerton.</h4>
	    		<h4>In 2016, I developed a passion for mulling over fun problems and coming up with clever solutions by taking CS 61A, the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs! I then took Data Structures & Algorithms, Foundations of Data Science, and Discrete Math & Probability (probably my favorite course thus far!). </h4>
	    		<h4>This semester, I am taking CS 61C, EE 16A, and EECS 126 (Computer Architecture, Designing Information Devices & Systems, and Probability & Random Processes)! For fun, I am a part of GamesCrafters to learn about game theory research and I am a course tutor for Foundations of Data Science.</h4>

	    		<h3 class=>Music Classifier</h3>
	    		<h4>Learned TensorFlow to build a basic, feedforward neural net to classify songs by genre given their lyrics </h4>
	    		<h4>Achieved 95% accuracy using a single ReLU hidden layer, a Softmax classifier layer, and AdamOptimizer to minimize cross entropy</h4>
	    		<h3 class=>Mini-SQL</h3>
	    		<h4>	Built a relational database management system (similar to SQL) </h4>
                <h4>Users may use the DSL to interact with and query databases</h4>
	    		<h3 class=>BearMaps</h3>
	    		<h4>Contributed the back-end portion of rastering, graph-building, and routing components to a navigation web app</h4>
				<h4>Used a quad-tree to find the appropriate (location, size, resolution) image to be displayed on the front-end</h4>
				<h4>Parsed public mapping data to construct a graph for routing</h4>
				<h4>Used a trie to implement text auto-completion</h4>
	    		<h3 class=>Puzzle Solver</h3>
	    		<h4>Used the A* algorithm to write a general puzzle solver which solves puzzles of a certain type in the fewest moves possible</h4>
